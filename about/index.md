title: About this site
type: page

Aaron was a tireless supporter of the open internet and an old-school hacker.
To honor his memory and his contributions to technical community, Aaron's family
and friends wanted to provide a way to share their memories that:

* uses free and open source software wherever possible
* licenses its content under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
* is open to the technical community to hack on and contribute to
* leverages tools that Aaron used and contributed to, like Markdown and RSS

The site itself is a work in progress; we can't do everything ourselves. To that end, we'd
like to invite other programmers to contribute to the improvement of the site on
[Github](https://github.com/rememberaaronsw/rememberaaronsw). Here are more features we'd
like to add:

* make it easy for a broader community of contributors to share memories, perhaps via 
  Github's Javascript API and CORS
* allows for sharing and contribution to Reddit
* provide compatibility across a diverse set of web platforms

If you'd like to contribute, please [fork the repo on Github](https://github.com/rememberaaronsw/rememberaaronsw)
and get hacking. Alternatively, you can [email your memories](mailto:rememberaaronsw@gmail.com) to share
them directly with Aaron's family and friends, who will work to shift them onto the website as quickly as possible.
