I didn't know Aaron but I'm a programmer, activist and free information advocate who was more than incredibly inspired by his activism, especially in taking on JSTOR and the institution of digital rights management in general.  He was a hero for me and I can't believe he's gone.  His demonstrated respect for the fellow human species was amazing.  We should feel obligated to carry his legacy, not just for him, but for the future of the world.
