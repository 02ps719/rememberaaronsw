Never met Aaron, but followed the "Demand Progress" initiative from overseas with more than usual interest. Especially the part related to ‘Kill Switch’ and other Internet related censorship actions.
Any US decision on this could affect Europe as well. The majority of our politicians are afraid not to follow “Big Brother USA” and take e.g. Internet censorship for granted.
 
Enough…
 
Please accept my most heartfelt sympathies for your loss. I'll say kaddish for Aaron in dear remembrance.
