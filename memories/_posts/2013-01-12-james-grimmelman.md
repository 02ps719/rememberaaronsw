The last time I saw Aaron in person was over dinner in Cambridge.
He was late, of course. We didnâ€™t talk about his trial, or about
any of his other data liberation exploits. Instead, we talked about
puzzles, and teamwork, and coding, and politics. I was up for tenure
that spring, and facing the prospect that for the first time in
years I would be simply free to choose my projects, without any
deadlines or institutions telling me what I ought to be doing. So I
asked him, in essence, what I should do with my life, because Aaron
seemed to have answered that same question for himself, with greater
courage, in the face of greater uncertainty, and with greater success
than anyone else I knew. He was 25.
