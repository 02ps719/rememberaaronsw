I have had the opportunity of meeting and working with Aaron on several occasions in my work with non profit, political organizations. He was a brilliant man and a kind and tender soul. On a couple of occasions I was able to share a beer or two with him and discuss various issues and his fervor for freedom of information would always shine through. He will be missed, not just as an advocate and force for transparency, but for his humanity and for just who he was. Rest in Peace Aaron, may you continue to inspire and hold a mark we should work to achieve.
