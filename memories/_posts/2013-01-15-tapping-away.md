Aaron, I'm glad we got to chat over veggie cheesesteaks at Gianna's when you 
were in Philly for the ALA conference, and I fondly remember you tapping away 
on your Sidekick during the talks in Portland in 2008. Like many others, I 
admired your work and purpose from afar, and am heartbroken by the pain your
death revealed.
