Aaron is a true hero of our time.

Like all passionate and visionary people, he rejected complacency and decided to walk the narrow path. He will be remembered as an example and an inspiration for all who, around the globe, believe that freedom is not an electoral nor a rhetorical concept but the most powerful aspiration for a human being.

Aaron's star has risen and will light the path of those you that have the courage to embark in the quest he as set afoot.
