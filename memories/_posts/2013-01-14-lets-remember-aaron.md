Let's raise our collective voices in celebration of Aaron's life and accomplishments.  Not many of us can say that we changed the world.  Aaron did, and he did it many times in his brief but glorious life. He fought for what he believed in, a powerful vision that knowledge was to be shared, that there could be thousands of open digital repositories, modern Alexandrias freely sharing our collective knowledge output for the betterment of us all.  What an amazing dream, and what an amazing life.  Peace be with you Aaron, and to those dearest to you.
