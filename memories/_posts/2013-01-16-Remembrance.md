To the parents and loved ones of Aaron Schwartz,

I didn't know him, but I knew of him as I guess millions did.  He gave us all so much.  This week's news of his death hit me so very hard.  Imagining this gifted young man being hounded to such a decision makes me ill.  When I found this site, I was so touched by the many many letters written about Aaron's work.  It is absolutely mind-altering to see posts from people in countries around the world.  In the short time that Aaron was here, he left huge footprints. I am glad to see that acknowledged.  I am very sorry for your loss and if there is a petition to remove the attorneys who pounded on him, I would like to sign it.
