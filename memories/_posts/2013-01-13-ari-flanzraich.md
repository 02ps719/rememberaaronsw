I won’t pretend that I have been a follower of Aaron’s for years and that I scoped out brilliance before it came to the mainstream, because that simply is not the case. But I have been reading every obituary there is to read online, and I feel a loss already. Smart’s are easy to come by, but an extraordinary human being accompanying the smart’s is almost impossible to find, and it seems like Aaron was one of those men that are almost impossible to find, yet, fortunately for us, are found.
