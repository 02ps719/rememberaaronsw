I think the first time the name Arron Swartz ever came into my consciousness was about 10 years ago, so long ago it was like ancient. Not sure what or why, I just stumbled into the little blog Raw Thought. I was immediately taken. What incredibly cool and intelligent writing, I remember myself thinking. I love the title Raw Thought, too. Cool guys  always come up with cool names.
