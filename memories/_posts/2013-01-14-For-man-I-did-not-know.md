I remember reading the story last year and in all honesty it seemed like one of those “American” lawsuites that would blow over but now seeing what the ultimate result of it has been, I can say without pause that there is something fundamentally WRONG with the US justice system. That being said, with respects to his family and his partner, for whatever it is worth from a small island in the middle of the Caribbean, I offer my condolences.
 
We can never say why we make the choices we do sometimes but for now, my heart goes out to you who must grieve as your love for him scars your hearts for this disconnect.
