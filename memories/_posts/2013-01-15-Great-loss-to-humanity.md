I was sick to my stomach to hear we have lost such a great sole.  I only got to know Aaron through his interviews on RT television, and I was praying I had the wrong guy, but sadly I didn't.
My heart goes out to his family, and his girlfriend.  May god give you strength through this difficult  time, and may god have Mercy on his sole.  We, the world misses you
