While I did not ever meet Aaron, I surely was a fan of his. There is so much of knowledge in his words and I was inspired by the idea that even young person can do so much to advance things in the world. Small actions matter, even while he surely did much good with larger things too.

All the strength to his family and friends in the moments of deep sadness.

I mourn with you.
