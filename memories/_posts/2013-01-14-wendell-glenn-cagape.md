Aaron, your passing on leaves the world less free. As a blogger who resides in the Philippines, I am saddened by your untimely demise. As your legacy lives in us, may we unlock the world to the realities that not all of those who access the net are rich and are capable and powerful, many are poor who needs the same information and accessibility. You will be remembered!
