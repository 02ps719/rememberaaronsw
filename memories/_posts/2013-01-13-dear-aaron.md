dear aaron,

we have never met, but I feel deeply connected with you. I know that we shared the same spirit of freedom in which there is no guilt, no hate and no fear. I share the pain of all the people that grieve for you. we all share our grieve and the precious memories we have of you and your free spirit. you were my brother, and in my heart, you will remain my brother forever.
