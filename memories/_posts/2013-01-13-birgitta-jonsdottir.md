In Aaron Swartz was the embodiment of the future for the information age and its freedoms we hold so dear. The Internet was our mutual home and I feel even if I never met him in person that I lost someone from my tribe.

He was and will be an inspiration to carry on our fight to keep the internet free, wild and borderless. His courage, vision and work has left permanent impression and standards online<3 and strength to his family and friends

May Aaron Rest in Peace & Pixels

With Rebellious Joy
