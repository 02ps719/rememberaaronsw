I didn't know Aaron. I first read about him when combing the internet for resources for my non-profit theater. I found Demand Progress and thought, what a great guy. And then I realized that he led the fight against SOPA. And he won. We won. Where was the celebration of his incredibly significant contribution? And the metaphor he gave us couldn't be greater. He protected the internet so that we can use it to achieve anything we need to. He demonstrated that the voice of the people can be effective. I feel that we let him down, by not celebrating him and by not responding with enough drama to the prosecution. I wish I had known him.
