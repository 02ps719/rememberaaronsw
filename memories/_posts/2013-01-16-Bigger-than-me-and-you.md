First and foremost, I want to offer my condolences on behalf of slamwall.com and all those who continue to embody Aaron Swartz's dream of a world where everybody can freely communicate and express themselves. I didn't know much about Aaron before his untimely death. However, I found it ironic that literally days into the development of slamwall.com, a site that promotes free speech, I was introduced to Aaron's dream. I instantly connected with him and his fight to protect freedoms that help shape the fabric of human interaction and learning. I was inspired by his words and his relentless approach to using his God-given talent to fight the powers that be. I can't begin to say how angry I am concerning the circumstances of his death, how disappointed I am in the fact I'll never be able to meet him--But I do appreciate his life and the lessons to be drawn from it. Aaron you are an inspiration to me and millions of others across the globe. Much love to your family and your legacy.
