To a brilliant Man

As a 15 years old It Student from Switzerland, Aaron was allway one of my Idols. I still see Aaron as a brilliant young man that allways stood up for his rights. One Day I'm going to tell my kids about this guy that did so much for the World and how his Story ended in such a Tragic. He was a Hero. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.
