Aaron was a great human being who saw more and understood more deeply than we who admired him and his being. His spirit was unbounded by the fetters of merely worldly pursuits. I never met him, but his humanity so powerfully radiated positive energy that one could not be unaffected even at a great distance. He is a shining exemplar of the essential takeaway of the ancient Upanishads: "One is all, All is One, and That are Thou." My gratitude for his free spirit is inexpressible.
