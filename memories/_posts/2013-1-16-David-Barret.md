I'm sorry, so sorry... I didn't know him, but reading about all he did... It's difficult not shed a tear... This man is a real hero for me... And this world needs more people like him...
As a programmer I am, I'll try make things than help and continue the legacy of Aaron

All my condolences for his family and friends

David from Spain
