I had never heard of Aaron Swartz until last Sat morning when I opened my twitter account, but immediately knew this was something big. Something so big in fact that it would change the way we think of life in a society bent on controlling access to the very information we need to pursue a more just and compassionate life. His passing will reverberate as a beacon of light for all those who never stop fighting for freedom. He could have veiled the truth by accepting the slander the DoJ was throwing at him, but chose instead to expose the degree of collusion and corruption pervading a system that rewards the guilty and punishes the innocent. And in so doing, opened the door of transparency on a system that mocks the very meaning of the word justice.
