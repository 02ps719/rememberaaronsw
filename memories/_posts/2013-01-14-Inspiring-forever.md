Aaron has impacted more people than he could imagine. His vision of information, of people and true democracy will survive far beyond himâ€¦and far beyond all of us. Life is precious and Aaron was taken away far too soon, but his vision is will not pass on: it is for now and it will be for tomorrow. It is up to people who respected Aaron and were inspired by him to truly pay their respects - by moving forward and ensuring his vision will become the world we will wake up in tomorrow and beyond.
