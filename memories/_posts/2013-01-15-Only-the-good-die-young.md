Aaron, I know you are reading this. See, how many people do love you ? See, how many people do miss you ? Why did you leave us ? You should have waited little bit longer my friend, maybe we would have figured it out, maybe we would have solved everything. We will continue, we were not intimidated, we will not be intimidated.

We know you, we know what you're trying to do, we know what your cause is. 

We will never forget.
