I am deeply touched by the many contributions and friendships Aaron made in his so very short life. He seemed to represent the best in humanity, as he put himself out there boldly and brilliantly to challenge the forces that many of us accept as givens. Sensitive people who dare to chart their own paths will find powerful friends as well as foes. No foe, however, can defeat the spirit of such a beautiful soul like Aaron. I grieve for what he must have had to live through in the past few years and am so sorry for his partner, family, and friends. It is now up to us to take over from where he left off. I will try to do my part.

Aaron reminds me of the “cosmos” flowers that stand strong and tall and proud and beautiful in the gardens that they grace.
