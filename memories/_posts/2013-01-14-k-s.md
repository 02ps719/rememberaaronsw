Like many around the world, I am distressed by the news of Aaron's passing. He was a man who walked the walk and did a lot to fight the good fight, to do his part to make this a more open world and fight for justice. He was, undoubtedly, a brilliant man, a smart troublemaker and a revolutionary of our postmodern times. Such brilliant thinking, such a forward vision! Inspiring. He was appreciated and admired by many and one can hope that many more people feel inspired to follow his example and be visionaries, revolutionaries and fighters themselves. He will definitely be remembered. So young, so inspiring, such a sad loss! Good night, Aaron, and thank you for your contributions to this world. May your legacy live on.
