Last year I lost someone who is - and I use the present tense here because I came to realize that people don't die - a very important part of my life. She went away in her 30's, and, just like Aaron, was (or is) too a genius. She is a woman ahead of her time, who, when amongst us, used to fight for justice, for what is legit rather than legal. When I heard about Aaron's death, my pain, once again, grew strong, and I cried. I cried because we are in need of people like him in this planet of so many pains and injustices. We are in need of men and women who can act out against what's wrong and illegitimate and immoral. He will be missed, but his legacy, and his dreams, will carry on.
