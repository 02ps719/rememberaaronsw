I would like to give my condolences to Aaronâ€™s family and partner. However big a loss his death is for the world, it is neglectable compared to what they must suffer now.
I use the products of Aaron's ingeniousness every day. Too bad he had to die before I realized how much Aaron influenced the world. Thank you Aaron for everything. I hope you have now found the peacefulness you sought.
To all the assholes who think the internet is theirs and who keep fighting in court for alleged rights on  whatever should be public domain: shame on you! First contribute something useful to the world before you claim anything.
Although I don't know you in person I will miss you a bit every day Aaron.
