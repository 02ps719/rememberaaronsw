I met Aaron once…didn’t take long to realize he was a brilliant and determined spirit.
At the beginning of the summer last year both of my parents were hospitalized simultaneously, forcing me to focus more on online activism rather than direct action.

Some of my first activity was standing with DemandProgress to fight for Internet freedom. That particular organization will always hold a special place in my heart & mind.

Aside from that…having battled depression for most of my life, I feel a deep sense of connectivity to Aaron and his struggles.

While we all acknowledge that the world is worse off having lost this young man, the legacy he leaves should inspire us all to fight for the truth we so desperately need and stand up for what we believe in.

Thank you Aaron Swartz…you accomplished more in 26 years than some accomplish in a lifetime!
