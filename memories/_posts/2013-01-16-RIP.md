I wish I had heard of Aaron before - his suicide had had a huge impact on me - like so many. His writing is amazing . Thank you Aaron for allowing more articles to be available to me on the web . To his parents - what an amazing son . His photos and life are haunting . What an inspiring young man. We will never forget you .
