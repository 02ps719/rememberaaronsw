What I have come to realize in America......."YOU TELL A LIE, YOU GET BY. YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, YOU GET THE BOOT!!  "We refuse to be what they want us to be, we are what we are and tha'ts  the way it's going to be....Bob Marley
Hoping your family, friends, associates and who's lives you are now touching hold you in their hearts as their great ancestor!!!
I have never met you physically....but my spirit mourns you spiritually. Aaron you have served your purpose not many 26y/o like you around!!!

PS.When you feel downtrodden....put pride aside, reach out and "TALK'' to someone, be it a stranger.....
