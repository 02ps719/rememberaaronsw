I'm only a normal woman, and also quite aged.
I'm an european, and here we all know how freedom is important, and we associate freedom with USA, from the Pilgrim Fathers sail to find a new country of freedom.
And now? I cannot stand this change in America's approach to individuals and their freedom!
I don't use Facebook or twitter, so I'm going with mail, sorry
