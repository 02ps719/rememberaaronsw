I never met Aaron, but I know him from his tremendous work in the tech industry and his blog that I frequently followed. Some things that I use everyday such as Reddit and RSS are possible because of Aaron.

I'm deeply saddened that Aaron has left us at such a young age when he could still have helped shape the world and accomplished so much more.

Thank you, Aaron, for what you have done to the world. You are an inspiration to all of us.

My thoughts and prayers are with Aaron's family and friends.

Rest in peace, Aaron.
