We would like to express our sincere condolences for the unexpected loss of your son. On behalf of the entire office of Campus Party Brazil, please accept our sympathy. We can only imagine what a difficult fatality this will be for you and your family.

In respect of Aaron’s contributions and in recognition of his work, we will make a tribute to him during Campus Party Brazil 2013, that will take place from January 28 to February 02. Furthermore, we will dedicate this edition to him, a person who we certainly believe had the “campusero” spirit.
