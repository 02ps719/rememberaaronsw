To say that Aaron made a difference in this world, at this time, is an understatement. He is most definitely one of the most remarkable human beings that I have ever had the privilege of learning from and he will be forever missed. In his honor, I will pledge to continue to keep the internet free from censorship and to say a silent prayer for the incredible soul each time I see RSS and anytime I sign a petition. My sincere condolences to his family and close friends ~ a horrible and tragic loss for all of us ~ Kim Noreen Anderson
 
To be alive in this beautiful, self-organizing universe -- to participate in the dance of life with senses to perceive it, lungs that breathe it, organs that draw nourishment from it -- is a wonder beyond words.”
