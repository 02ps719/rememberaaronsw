I didn't know Aaron ... but I now fully understand his rich legacy.  In a world of self-deception where many convince themselves that what they are doing is for the 'good of all', but where their true hearts are trying to get what they want, when they want it, and how they want it ... Aaron was a martyr for TRUTH.  Nothing else ... JUST TRUTH.  "No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends." (Jn. 15:13)  He wanted truth for us ... humankind.  Godspeed, Aaron.
