Dear family and friends of Aaron,
 
I didnâ€™t know him until this sad event,
 
I have learned a lot about him since then,
 
And in a memorial of my own,
 
I have retraced his thoughts and aspirations,
 
If only from the web, the sphere that he so loved,
 
I look at his pictures and see,
 
that sincere, open, loving quality and strength of spirit,
 
Which only the pure of heart  and  lovers of humanity have,
 
I now, know your dear Aaron in my soul and spirit, even if only in heartfelt imagination,
 
I feel love for your dear one, and know your sorrow,
 
. . . yet those who have moved on are always with us,
 
May you be blessed, and love and healing flow into your life,
 
Rita Verma
