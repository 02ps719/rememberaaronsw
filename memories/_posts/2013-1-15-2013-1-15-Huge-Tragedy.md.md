To the family and friends of Aaron, I am so very extremely sorry for your immense loss. 

Everyone who loves tech and benefits from the Internet, who is grateful for Aaron's work on SOPA, owes him huge thanks. His death by persecution makes us all poorer. He was handsome, brilliant, kind, unique. He did not deserve this and neither did those who loved him. I hope that prosecutor pays. I've signed the petition.

Prayers that you find some comfort, and that Aaron is the beautiful Angel he deserves to be.
