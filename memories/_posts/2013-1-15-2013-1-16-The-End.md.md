This is the end
Beautiful friend
The end
Of our elaborate plans
The end
Of everything that stands
The end
No safety or surprise
The end
Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free...

-- Jim Morrison,
also hounded by a criminal
criminal justice system

Good bye Aaron, Beautiful Friend
Onto to bigger and better things
