Just reading through all these memories brings a tear to my eye. As a high schooler, an entrepreneur, a hacker, and an activist, Aaron was always an inspiration to me to keep doing what I was doing, whatever it might be. While I was reading through memories on here, trying to think of something to say that would make Aaron proud, I realized something. He still inspires me, after he's gone. I kept telling myself that I'd be able to meet him somewhere. A conference or something, and it pains me to think that this will never come to be. Aaron has created a legacy that is perpetuated by each memory on this site, and will be remembered internationally for generations. A brilliant mind and a kindred spirit, driven to the edge by an overzealous lawsuit against free speech and free information.
