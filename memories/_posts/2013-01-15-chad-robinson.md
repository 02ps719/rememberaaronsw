I cannot say that I knew Aaron well. What I knew about him was scraps of things I learned from following him on Twitter or reading a blog post he wrote here and there. I cannot say I understand why his death troubles me so, but I pray that the crushing weight of grief soon gives way to the ease of relief for those close to him, for those who knew and loved him. I hope that my own actions can one day help bring some of his ideals to reality, bring honor to his memory and glory to his legacy.

Resquiescat in pace,

Chad
