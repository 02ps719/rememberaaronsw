I couldn't believe my eye and shouted in front of my computer when I saw this bad news, I was sweating and keeping on shaking my head.

Aaron has done dozens of great things in his so short life, which I couldn't image I can do even one of them in my whole life... He co-authored RSS specification 1.0, architecture of Open Library and founder of Reddit, he is "the hero of open world"!

This is the very first time for me, have such a strong query to the American level system: there must be unreasonable part, IMHO.

天妒英才！
