Most importantly:
All my most sincere condolences for his family and friends.

I blame MIT first. MIT will never be associated with knowledge in my mind anymore. Simply another corrupt organization where profit has become more important than the advancement of science.
The only way MIT can save face is by making public every single paper they have, in his name.
The American justice system is also to blame. The witch hunt has to stop. He was treated worse than we treat mass murders in my country.
Downloading scientific papers should never be a crime. I hope they all take learning from this.
