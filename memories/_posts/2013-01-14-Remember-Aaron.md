Dear Aaron.

I didn't know about you until yesterday. Regretfully I can only apologize for that ignorance in my mind to myself. But perhaps I can also do the following. Because what I came to realize, while reading about your remarkable work in the US and connecting the dots to how things have played out for internet freedom here in Europe, was that I share something with you. I have done so for a long time. I share your passion. Your passion for a more equal and just world without corruption and the same foul power struggles that led you to see no other way out. My soul is your soul in this very regard. I will not stop fighting for social, economic and intellectual emancipation, and you will not be forgotten. It is a bit weird, ironic or perhaps paradoxical, but I feel a little less alone. And a lot more affirmed of my convictions.
