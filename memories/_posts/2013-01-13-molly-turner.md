I did not know Aaron, but as a mother of one like him, I am grief-stricken. He was my child’s rock star.

People may not realize, but being prodigious—especially in a field where few people even speak your language (code), is very hard, and seeing this ending is heart breaking. I wish I had written to Aaron to tell him how he affected not just the big picture, but even individuals. He gave my son context in this world.  His memory will stay in our family always.  I will make sure it does.

MIT will not be on our list when our son comes of age to share his gifts with the world.

Aloha and peace from Maui.
