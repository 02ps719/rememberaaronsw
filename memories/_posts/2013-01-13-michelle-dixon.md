With so many memories running through my head of the amazing, brilliant, funny, kind and passionate Aaron Swartz, one that stands out in particular is of him and Taren sitting out in the sunlight on our Rev. House deck reading out loud to each other. With smiles and passion on their faces, occasionally they would pause to discuss a particular probing question or insight. It was beautiful and deeply inspiring to watch these two brilliant minds and the tenderness they shared for each other. I remember thinking how inspired I was by both of their deeply curious, probing, loving and justice seeking natures and the clear love and affection they shared for one another. And I always will be.
