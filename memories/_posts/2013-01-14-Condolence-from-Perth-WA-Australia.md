To Susan, Robert and Family
 
So sorry for your lost.  If we could turn back time for just a minute. Though we never knew Aaron....we are saddened to hear of your loss.  No parent should bury their child first.  The world has lost a dear heart and a great soul.
Our love and condolence to all the Family and Loved One.
