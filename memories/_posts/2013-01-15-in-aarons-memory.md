I did not know Aaron but his death has deeply impacted me. His strength and courage to support freedom even against the most powerful enemies have enlightened me about the dangers we are facing if we do not take seriously our responsibility to keep internet free. We have to do this in his memory and in the memory of all the people that have fought for freedom during history.

My sincere condolences to Aaron's family.
