Hi
 
This is truly a tragedy not just for US or MIT but for all youths who support the cause of open access to information. I am from India and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about you AARON. Hope god gives the peace to the departed soul of our beloved friend Aaron, the real champion of freedom.
 
Regards,
Gaudham. R
