This is about a boy called Aaron
When fourteen he helped play a part
In writing some of the code that makes the web start

When Twenty he made some of the most popular sites like Reddit
When Twenty Two he downloaded most of the  knowledge tree
Hoping to set it free

He got caught
Aaron distraught
Killed himself at twenty six

And the corporations sighed in relief
One more hacker threat neutralized
We got lot more to be realized

We own the cops , lawyers and the news
In the meantime, lets be nice for public relationship views
And send some roses to Aaronâ€™s mom
