I, too, have a boy, who is now 13, a brilliant child. He does not think in a typical fashion. He sees injustice in what many accept as normal and has a unique view of the world.

He is a visual artist, thoughtful and sensitive; he is here with me now, asleep and bound to wake up early, drawing, creating, living, and loving. When I think of my boy, I can only imagine, Aaronâ€™s fear and pain, then I weep for him, and I pray.
