Though I never met Aaron, I believe all of us who value freedom of expression and the ability to share information around the world instantly via the internet, owe him a huge debt of gratitude. A hacker with a conscience extraordinaire, a brilliant, compassionate young man who fought for the rights of all those who believe in information freedom and network neutrality: We love you Aaron, and you will be sorely missed.
