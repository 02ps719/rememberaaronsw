Dear grieving friends and family,

I have been deeply moved and reminded once again about the devastating effects of depression.
The web of life has been diminished by the sudden and tragic departure of your beloved boy.

I hold you all in my thoughts and prayers as you begin to navigate this rough terrain of acceptance.
As the shock wears off and you begin to heal be kind and patient with yourselves.
Avail yourselves to the love that surrounds. 

I pray that Aaron's pain is fading away in the loving arms of the Creator.
