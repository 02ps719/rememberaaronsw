I knew of Aaron by his work with Demand Progress and SOPA, but I didn't know his name or face until I read more about him after his death. From what I have read and seen in videos, he was a gentle soul who cared about the truth and the People's rights. He was not a criminal by nature, and merely used bad judgement. But that bad judgement was not serious enough to be facing the kind of charges the government slapped on him. I believe they were looking for revenge, and to make an example of him. Those that did that deserve nothing less than to be stripped of their jobs. I hope you are able to at least receive some kind of an apology for this miscarriage of justice, and the tragic consequence. May it comfort you to know that I, and many others, see him as a hero.
