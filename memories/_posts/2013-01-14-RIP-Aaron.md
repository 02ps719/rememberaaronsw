At a time when many of our freedoms are on the chopping block, to lose Aaron is a heavy blow for us. And for what?? What did MIT and the State of Massachusetts stand to gain by their persecution and prosecution of Aaron, and for what cause? We need to take a hard look at who was behind it and rethink our loyalties.
