"So many people knew Aaron as a programmer, an activist, and a visionary. I never did. To me, Aaron was "Taren's boyfriend," the funny, unassuming guy she'd bring along to berry-picking or swimming when we lived in DC. It turned out that Aaron was one of the most accomplished people I'd ever met--though I only pieced it together after I recognized his photo in a news article. And even after that, it was a struggle to remember that the guy who was so good at swinging on the swimming quarry's Tarzan ropes was a co-founder of Reddit, or that the guy who mentioned he'd done some work on ethics was one of the most important voices for Internet freedom. I've never known anyone who wore so much accomplishment so lightly. And reading about him again these last days, I've gotten the sense that that selflessness was at the heart of who Aaron was."
