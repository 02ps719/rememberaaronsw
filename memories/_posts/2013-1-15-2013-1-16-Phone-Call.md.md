My deepest condolences to your family.  I was introduced to Aaron's story only today but it connected on so many levels that I had to write about it. Here is the link:  http://mirandaaisling.com/idea-no-41-a-phone-call-for-aaron-swartz/

I'm sharing my writing because it is the only way I can make sense of such tragedies.
