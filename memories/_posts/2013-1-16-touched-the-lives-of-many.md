Though we may never have met in person, aaron's work, his views, even his very presence, has touched the lives of many, ourselves included. His was a light that burned for all, and the world will be dimmer for his loss. Still, let us remember what he stood for, and let his dream become reality. A free open world for all, a little bit at a time.

For one so young to leave a legacy so expansive... Aaron, we salute you, and may your name live on for an eternity.
