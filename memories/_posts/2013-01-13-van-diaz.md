Intelligent, driven, insatiably curious, and fiercely passionate. That’s how I’ll remember him. He was the reason I joined Demand Progress. He’s the reason I stood up and believed I could make a difference. He touched my life. He changed my life.

I’ll see you on the other side, Aaron. Thank you, for everything.
