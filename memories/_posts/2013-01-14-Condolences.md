I did not know Aaron personally, but I feel so sad for his sudden
and tragic 'missing' mostly as a human being, and secondarily 
as a 'giant' of the fight for justice as the open access to scientific information on the Internet is concerned.

I believe he'll be missed and remembered forever all over the world.
