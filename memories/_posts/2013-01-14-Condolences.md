My deepest heartfelt condolences to Aaronâ€™s family and friends
I never met Aaron Swartz, and never knew him personally, however i realized through news that Aaron Swartz was a kind of specie out of this world. Young, Brave, curious as every genius man must be, full of passion . Aaron, your bright light will be sorely missed in this world. A huge loss for the humanity,  peace be with your immediate family and friends.
