I did not know Aaron personally but I am quite familiar with two of his
projects. Reddit of course, and the less known web.py framework. I use the
latter on many of my website related projects and can appreciate the
philosophy behind it. A philosophy he shared, one for minimal, well
working and robust tools for writing software. His mindset is one of a
dying breed of programmers/hackers and it's a tragedy that he was lost.
But through this website and framework his great contributions to the
Reddit community and the open source software community alike he will live
on. My regards to the family and friends of Aaron.
