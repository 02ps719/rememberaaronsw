Aaron has chosen to leave, that is his choice and as such it must be respected. But let’s also point out that despair is only a few steps away from freedom. The deepest possible despair needs to be faced in order to truly break free. It is incredibly sad, when someone so bright (too bright for this world?) leaves much too early.

Let his life be an inspiriration to us all to keep fighting, to keep building a better world, where free expression and open standards become the norm for everyone. I think Quinn Norton said it best in her tweet: “Make the world that wouldn’t have killed him, please”.
Let’s.
