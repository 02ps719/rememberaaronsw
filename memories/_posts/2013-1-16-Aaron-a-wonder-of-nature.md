I did not know of him, but I heard now the video of his speech in Washington, D.C., and I was amazed by the intelligence, the sense of social justice, the belief in ideals and in bringing them to realization, the kindness and empathy. For a human being to combine all these qualities is this extremely rare combination of genes, a marvel of nature! I hope that he will continue to have an impact on a world of young people thirsty for a better humanity!
WE ARE ALL AARON!
