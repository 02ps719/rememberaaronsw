Dear Susan & Robert,
            Please do accept my condolences. I am Aaron's colleague at ThoughtWorks. Though we have never met, I have been deeply moved by his work & have been incessantly talking to people about this case rife with injustice & victimisation. I even wrote about it here: http://inagardencalledlife.blogspot.com/2012/12/barbaric-american-judicial-system.html
                         I tried reaching out to Aaron hoping he would want to discuss things but I presume he was busy & doubted whether a faceless stranger could be of use to him. I am shattered in the realisation that I couldn't help him. I am sorry for your loss, for our loss. So full of vitality & goodness was his life that death was perhaps not something anyone associated with him. His was a life that had the soul to feed the many many inspired lives that will not make his death in vain. Your son has done you proud and is a son that every mother & father would cherish to have reborn in their family. I pray for his soul. I pray for your strength.

                         Anand
