.... in ancient medieval times witches had been burnt as their knowledge about healing effects of herbes looked spookey for the doctor meds and reigns.... and scientists who destroyed the common worldview (as a god made planet) with their researches had been banned from Universities, same happened to reformators by catholic church... nothing changed till today as we see with Internet pre-thinker/rebel Aaron S. fighting for liberty of the WWW... ending tragically in depression and suicide. Its ashaming for our modern post-industrialized societies that such visionary brains like Aaron dont find a legal place to work with benefit for more human societies... R.I.P. and my condolences to the family.
