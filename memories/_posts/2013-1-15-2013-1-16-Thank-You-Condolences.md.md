All he wanted to do was help everyone. Everything he did, he did it for us. Sadly, we did not do enough for him.

I didn't know him before this, but after I heard about everything he did for us (Creative Commons, Reddit, RSS, JSTOR, etc.), I realised this man is a rare gem in this world - extremely intelligent, yet extremely empathetic and good. Aaron, I'm sorry it took your death for me to realise the person behind all these great things I take for granted. I hope your death isn't in vain and it galvanises at least some people into action - the ripples will spread.

I hope his family is doing okay, and my sincerest condolences - your Aaron was the best person you could have had. Stay strong!
