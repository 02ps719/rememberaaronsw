My love to you reading this.

Thinking of you all. I would love to see a foundation/trust emerge quickly to promote Aaron's values and support activists who take risks. I would like to donate and I am sure many others would. Could be useful to look into this quickly while we still have momentum and can figure out more details later. I will also propose to Aaron's friend Ben Wikler who I met with Aarron.

My memory is below.

From Dublin, Ireland: Aaron's light shines on

I met Aaron in Boston in 2010 when I interviewed him for SpunOut.ie. (Video interview: http://youtu.be/JUt5gjqNI1w ).  I was struck by Aaron's warmth, wit, intelligence, passion, determination, and courage. It is not often you meet people like this. Aaron was a bright star during dark times - a true freedom fighter with a huge heart. He worked tirelessly to promote the values that so many preach but so few live by; truth, justice, peace, transparency, democracy, honesty, and integrity. Let us remember him by increasing our efforts to act, to love, to shine, and support one and other. Aaron's light shines on.
