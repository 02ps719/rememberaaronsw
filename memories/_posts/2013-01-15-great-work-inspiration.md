I didn’t know Aaron, but it’s a huge loss for all of us. I benefit, like so many others, from everything that Aaron has initiated. He brought us so many things, tools for our part on the way to the future. An creative and innovative guy and for a lot of us, a real hero of our generation.  My deepest condolences to his family and friends.

From Berlin, Germany
