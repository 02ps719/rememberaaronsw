I am so sorry for your loss — cross that. The WORLD’S loss. This is so heartbreaking.

I spent a few hours reading through his entire blog and quoting some of the most notable things that he’s written.
They’re now featured on the Quotesome front page, and if you hit next you’ll keep getting a new quote by him: http://www.quoteso.me/quotes/224770
I felt so compelled to do this because I think the news is presenting a lame, watered-down version of Aaron (he was right about the news and media). He was so much more. He was complex and multifaceted…
I am heartbroken to hear about his loss.
R.I.P.
