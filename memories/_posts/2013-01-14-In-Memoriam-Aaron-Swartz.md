Humanity lost a great mind, but he will always be remembered, since he joined the ranks of immortals, as in the words of Rumi below.

Yaman Cakiroglu
------------------------------------------------------
I died as a mineral and became a plant,
I died as plant and rose to animal,
I died as animal and I was Man.
Why should I fear? When was I less by dying?
Yet once more I shall die as Man, to soar
With angels blessed; but even from angel hood
I must pass on: all except God doth perish.
When I have sacrificed my angel-soul,
I shall become what no mind e'er conceived.
Oh, let me not exist! for Non-existence
Proclaims in organ tones,
To Him we shall return.

Rumi
