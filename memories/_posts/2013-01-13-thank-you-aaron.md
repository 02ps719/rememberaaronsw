I did not know Aaron, but tonight, iPhone in hand, I cannot help but read the eulogies and realize the impact this young man had made. I mourn with your friends and family tonight, Aaron. Thank you for being an advocate for what we believe in and I am sorry to learn of your life and loss. Peace be with your immediate family and friends.
