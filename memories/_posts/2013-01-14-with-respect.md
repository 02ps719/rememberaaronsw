I did not know Aaron until I read articles on his passing, and realised he was the person behind many of the tools I use. From RSS to Demand Progress, the realisation that a prime mover behind all that is good about the Internet is gone, leaves a hollow feeling inside. We honour his legacy by continuing his struggle to liberate information for the public, and to continuously strive for a better future for all peoples on this planet.
