Aaron has affected this world in a way that not many have, and we're all better off for his efforts, and I'm sad that we weren't blessed with his presence, efforts and gifts for a lot longer than turned out to be the case.

Aaron made a shining example of what is possible when there is someone to light the way out of the darkness that is in the world. Thank you Aaron, for all that you did, all that you were and all that you have yet to inspire.
