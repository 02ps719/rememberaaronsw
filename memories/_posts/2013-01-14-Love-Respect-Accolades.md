I cannot say that I knew Aaron personally, but I have grown a relationship with what is now his legacy. Any being who has ever used an RSS reader, written on a blog or remixed a copyleft image has inadvertently interacted with Aaron. His work will forever ring within the infinite hallways of knowledge, fueling the unbreakable spirit that is information liberation. Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu.
