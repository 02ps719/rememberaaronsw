To Aaron's Loved Ones
 
I didn't know Aaron but I am compelled to write to his loved ones.  Lines from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet are so fitting for this beloved young man who is gone from this existence:  "When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night."
 
Blessings....and Aloha
