Checked facebook and then all those RIP Aaron Swartz showed up. I first thought: is that real?? I found out that he had committed suicide. It just made my day a bad one when I found out. If he wasn't driven to suicide we maybe could see a lot of new inventions from him in the future. But now we, hackers are one more down. I wish that no more hackers will commit suicide in the future. RIP Aaron Swartz, a great man for both the internet and mankind.
