The system will without doubt reason away any responsibility.
The system will close ranks.
The system will count their dollars.
The system will not know what it missed.
The system will not truly honour the free spirit.
The system thatâ€™s us; so be critical of your own contribution.
 
Aaron, respect, RIP
