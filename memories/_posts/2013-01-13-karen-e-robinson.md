I met Aaron the year after he'd graduated from college, and was in Boston staying with Paul Graham before how to move forward.  He was speaking at an event at Harvard's Science Center that day, and a Harvard friend had invited me---my friend knew Aaron through Y-Combinator.  Those were the days you could type "aaron" into Google and click "I'm feeling lucky" to get [aaronsw.com](http://aaronsw.com/), which I thought was pretty cool.  

I probably only talked to him for 15 minutes, as the group walked to get student pizza for lunch or something, but Aaron struck me.  I was impressed by his drive to do things that were worthwhile, and I thought he was affable.  Years later when I noticed that he was the founder of Demand Progress, I remembered how much I had liked him.  

Although Aaron was someone I barely knew, I miss him.
