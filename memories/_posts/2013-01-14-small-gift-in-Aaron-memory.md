I'm so sorry for your loss.

This small gift is in honor of Aaron Swartz. I had long considered posting my book as open access but had hesitated in doing so. Aaron’s tragic death prompted my urgent reconsideration and offering. 

For me, it is the pictures of Aaron, the goodness and sweetness of a young man working for just, equal society through open access, that are especially haunting.

“Aaron dead. World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us weep.” Tim Berners-Lee

Thank you, Aaron, for making the world a better place. May you rest in peace and your death kindle a movement.
