I was sad to hear of the passing of Aaron Swartz. He had long been an inspirational figure to me, especially when I was younger. When I was 13 and had just started releasing open source software, I read an article about Aaron and is involvement with the RSS spec at age 14 and I thought to myself “I wonder if I could do something like that?”. To me, he represented what I aspired to be, a kid playing with and being respected by the big kids. Aaron accomplished quite a lot in his short life and I can only hope to accomplish a small fraction of what he did by the time I’m 26.

Rest in Peace, Aaron.
