Brilliant, gifted, ingenious, passionate, uncontainable, irrepressible, unforgettable...So very much like my daughter who succumbed the same way 3 springs ago. I pray for the strongest of God's embraces to hold and comfort Aaron's friends and family on this uninvited journey. I pray that Aaron has been dispatched to peace and heavenly glory.
