Aaron
 
He was blessed with sensitivity and insight and Intelligence.
 
Aaron could see the entrapment of society and opted out. He resembled chutzpah (Modern Context and Classic Arabic Meaning).
Aaron will be carried into the Heavenâ€™s for he Knew something better waited for a Sensitive Soul like his.
With tears in my eyes farewell !
