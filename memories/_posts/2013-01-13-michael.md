I didn’t know Aaron. My sincere condolences go to his family and friends. What a wonderful person Aaron must have been! And what a loss his tragic death means to all people who believe that freedom shall never be taken for granted. The U.S. government’s case against Aaron will be closed. The government has lost it forever, that is for sure now and the only consolation.
