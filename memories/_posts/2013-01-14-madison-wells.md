I do not know Aaron, I have never met him but from everything I am reading that his friends and family have posted, I can see that he was one of a kind and had a huge heart and that he had the mind to change the world. I would like to thank him for everything he did and give him a hug for everything he stood for and stood against. Thank you Aaron, RIP. I wish peace to your friends and family as well.
