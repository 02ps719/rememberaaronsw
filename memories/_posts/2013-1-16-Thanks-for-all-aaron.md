I share your view that information should always be free. Your passing saddens me deeply. There’s a lot of people out there who don’t understand you, who crazy and stupid enough to go after you after all you’ve done for humankind. I can imagine your sadness when the the majority of the world doesn’t share your view. But we, people who share your views, will always remember you and carry the torch you passed. You’re not alone.
