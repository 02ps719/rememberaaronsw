To add an image:I never met you, Aaron, but as someone of many more years and absolutely no understanding of how computing works, I have regularly felt the presence of spirits like yours---those who are marshaling technology to make our world a more just one. From all I read today about your gifts, you were one of those spirits indeed, a nerd who would change the world not by commoditizing your genius but rather by sharing it freely with all.  And it seems you were already walking that talk.  Good for you.  Good for the rest of us.
  
Only 48 hours after your flight and I already I feel the presence of your absence.  We are what we have lost.
