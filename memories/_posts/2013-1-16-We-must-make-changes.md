It is unfortunate that such a brilliant and passionate person ended in such a tragic way.  Our judicial system is broken, our education system is broken, our society is broken!  If we all don't do something to fix these things Aaron will not be the last one persecuted to the point of hopelessness.  It is my sincere hope that something positive can come out of this loss and some of the broken things in our society can be fixed.  I plan on doing something towards Aaron's cause everyday.  If we all do the same maybe we can make a difference, if not for ourselves but for Aaron and generations to come.
