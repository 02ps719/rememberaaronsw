"Baruck Hashem" May God bless the memory of your son. We have a grandson the age of
Aaron who is a computer genius but who is not interested in the lofty ideals which
Aaron exhibited. My wife and I feel deeply for your loss and may Hashem give us the courage to be like him when it comes to fighting for our freedom, our rights… We did not know a thing about him before this tragedy but we will remember him and his sacrifice for the rest of our lives… For Shame-----for our government to participate and orchestrate this horrific set of circumstances.

May Aaron be remembered as a blessed memory not only by you, his loving family but by intelligent and thoughtful people everywhere. We are planting trees in Israel in his memory.
