Aaron’s death taught us that law is absurd when the law does not fulfill the society’s moral. The US Attorney, Carmen Ortiz, has excessively abused her power and public resource in this case. She is strong willed prosecutor but Aaron showed us that he is fearless in his belief and his innocence. Good be with you Aaron, we will not forget you and thank you for all the things you have taught us.
