What a huge loss for the world. I didn't know Aaron, but I feel terrible sadness over his death. That a warm, loving, extremely intelligent man took his own life is just heartbreaking. The world is a better place for all that Aaron accomplished, yet the world today is wounded and diminished by the loss of such a innovative, creative, and caring individual. We collectively mourn his untimely passing, and I send thoughts of love and healing to his family and friends everywhere.

Sincerely, John Candell
