Aaron, you were a rarity amongst humanity. Brave, full of passion and
ever curious. Your bright light will be sorely missed in this world.

Richard Feynman. Buckminster Fuller. I never met them. But fate was
kind enough to cross our paths. You were only 14 when we met and
already more brilliant than what most of humanity has to offer.

Your willingness to jump in and help others set you apart in a league
of your own. It was extraordinary. Inspirational.

Sleep well my brother and forgive me my neglect.
