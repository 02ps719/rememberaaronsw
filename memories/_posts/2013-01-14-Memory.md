Dear Aaron,
We never met but your work has touched my life and millions of others, helping to make our world a better place.  The world has lost one of the most intelligent, creative and caring people in your passing and I fear it will be a more unjust place without you.  I am sadden and appalled to read of the injustice of the charges brought against you, and to think that your death could have been prevented.  Thank you for being a truly amazing and inspirational person who fought passionately for the rights of others.  My thoughts and prayers are with your friends & family.
May you find peace.
A friend
