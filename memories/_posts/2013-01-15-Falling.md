Falling, falling from grace…from the Tree

of Life….

a Child, a young sapling….

broken, under the boot of Tyranny.

We will remember…the little Child who led us…large in spirit and courage...Remember

….the children who are gone, when the Future lies empty of Promise…

…for we are blind and are stumbling into a terrible Darkness…..take care!

where next you tread, for your own Ones may be lost to the chaos…again trampled

without Thought or Care for what is to come.
