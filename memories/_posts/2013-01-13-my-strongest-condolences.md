I had the privilege to be a colleague of Aaron’s briefly at ThoughtWorks.  He left a vast impression on all who met him.  One true regret of mine is never having had the opportunity to work with him, or to get to know him better than casually during that time.  I don’t have to tell you how Aaron’s ideas and actions inspired - others can and have done that better and more eloquently than me.

At this point, I simply wanted to express how my heart goes out to his family and loved ones.  As someone who’s lost someone so young in similar circumstances (my brother took his life at 29), I know how devastating it can be to lose someone so suddenly and so tragically.  I know that it might feel like it won’t ever get better.  My sole advice is to simply cherish the time you had, and focus on the happy memories and not this last tragic moment.  It will be hard, and painful, but it will get better.

Let him live fondly in your memory, as I know he will.

My strongest condolences.
