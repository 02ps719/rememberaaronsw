His death really saddens me, he did not deserve what he was going through. I've been reading his blog posts and listening to some of his speeches, and it is obvious he was very talented and more importantly a person with a good heart .He is an inspiration to others, and certainly won't be forgotten.  Rest in peace Aaron :'(...
