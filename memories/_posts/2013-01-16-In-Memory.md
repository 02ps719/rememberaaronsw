Hello,
I’m a French user of web. Sorry for my English maybe approximative. In France, no news of this great man, no news of this file.
I’m very sorry to be inform of his dead. I believe his soul is near of god, and his fight must be our fight.
I hope peoples will understand it is very important to serve the knowledge and the free exchange of that
I would say a prayer for him and everyone  which have the same fight.
Very respectfully.
