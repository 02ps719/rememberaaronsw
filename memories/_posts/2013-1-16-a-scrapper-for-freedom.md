I didn’t know Aaron…I didn’t know who he was until yesterday….I began to pick up the pieces of his life and struggles in a mosaic of blogs and letters and posts and video’s…he embodied the bright light…a light so powerful a threat that the darkness pursued him and sought to extinguish his fire….he fought for freedom…be it the Internet or the injustice of a system bent on hoarding resources and entitlements for the few…he was smart…authentic....a scrapper for freedom…relentless in his quest to share knowledge with all of us…

So if you are curious of the walls that separate you and then you want to break them down....if you feel that burning desire to free yourself… to rage at the machine..then in some way you know Aaron too….and maybe just maybe….his passing will remind of us what we know….out most brilliant light is fleeting and we should forge the mosaic while it shines….I pray we carry the torch as well as you did Aaron….Rest well in peace...
