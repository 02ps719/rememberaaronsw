Aaron Swartz ought to be the last one. 

I would love to honor Aaron by making myself of service to others who suffer.

The recent suicide of Aaron Swartz is tragic. No human should ever take their life.

I’ve been there. I’ve been suicidal, completely overwhelmed with my current situation, ready to move on. I had loving people around me. I had people trying to help me. I knew people cared. But I didn’t care.
