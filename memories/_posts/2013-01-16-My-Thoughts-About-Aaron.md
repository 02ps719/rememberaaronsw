Facing this huge loss

I did not know even his name until the day after the fateful Friday when the tragic news spread like fire over the internet. 

As I started to read about Aaron and his accomplishments, to absorb his thoughts, writings, energetic commitment to justice and freedom, my sorrow grew with every word, every interview. I am in sorrow for the loss to his family and friends, and I am in sorrow for the loss to the nation and to the world.

We cannot lose a person such as Aaron, without leaving a hole in the heart and a deep sadness for all that we have lost.

On Aaron's behalf, and in his honor, I feel we must push back against the forces of tyranny that pushed on him to destroy the peace in his life, and I hope to play a part in that movement. Let us all please move to reform this detestable system of "justice" so we can someday say it without the quotes.

In other times, we lost another loving wonderful man when Robert Kennedy was assassinated, and in honor of Aaron, I need to quote something that Robert Kennedy said that so very much applies to Aaron:

“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”
Let's make sure the current he started continues to knock down the walls of oppression.
My condolences to his family and friends.

I miss him and grieve for his loss.
