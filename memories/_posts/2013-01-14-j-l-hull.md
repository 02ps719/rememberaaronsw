I have seldom felt so much immediate love for someone I never met.  Tears fill my eyes.
Aaron was the visionary pure hearted genius prankster our world needed to have a good look at itself.
Oh how I wish he could have worked his magic for a long lifetime!
Oh Aaron - Thanks for all you gave to all of us!   May your spirit  rise to the highest realms of love!
