To those who loved Aaron,

I met Aaron last year at Freedom 2 Connect. I was inspired by his keynote speech and approached him afterward about participating in our documentary on the Internet, War for the Web. We sat down with Aaron on July 10, 2012 and he shared with us some of his thoughts on growing up during the age of the Internet, the importance of the freedom of speech and access to information, and how individuals are responsible for the future of the Internet. He was very generous with his time and had an indelible impact on the entire crew. Although we are still in production, we wanted to share some of Aaron's insights with those that loved and cherished him.
