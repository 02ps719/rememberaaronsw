I first met Aaron at the Creative Commons launch party in 2002. He was bouncing around like the inspired, liberated, 16-year-old that he was, and he was already legend. His energy was overwhelming, his enthusiasm for all the promise of free information was gut-level inspiring. DJ Spooky was at the music station and Aaron danced around him, and danced around Lessig. A few years later, in '08, Aaron came to visit us at our library with an EFF crew, and was generously enthusiastic about our handful of commonalities. He reveled in the printed stacks and stayed for a deep exploration. Can't end this paragraph, because can't yet begin to end the expectation that he will be back for more.
