I never got the honor of meeting Aaron in person, but he was as close to a 'hero' as I have ever had. His ideals spoke to mine- and his follow-through was inspiring. He didn't just talk about changing the world, he did it. I thought that as long as he was leading the way, we, as a community in the U.S. and around the world, could end so many injustices. I feel lost now. Who out there can take up where he left off? Even those of us driven to try are not nearly as intelligent, creative, or as daring. I hope that the grief over this tragedy is not wasted. I hope people everywhere take up Aaron's work and his passion. I hope we can honor his memory by achieving his dreams.
