The internet was Aaron's native medium, and he understood its potential to empower through access to information. He also understood the need to fight against the corporations and governments who would seek to restrict that access. And most importantly, he understood the stakes of this fight: that it was not just about the future of the internet, but about the future of society itself. While many agree with that sentiment, very few people have been willing to put their lives on the line to defend it.   

Though Aaron was an accomplished technologist, he also recognized technology's limits. In one of the last conversations I had with him, he expressed concern about promoting the idea that online organizers could optimize and automate their way to victory. Even though he had spent the past year of his life figuring out how to increase action rates on petitions, he wanted us to remember that our work is more about touching hearts and minds than it is about perfecting 1s and 0s.

Hopefully his passing will inspire many to take bold actions for a better world.  R.I.P. Aaron.  See you on the other side.
