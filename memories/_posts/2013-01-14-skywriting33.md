I, like many, had heard of Aaron, admired his achievements and bemoaned his bullying by the powers that be.  On behalf of every free thinking person thank you for your courage, insight, passion and progressive thinking.  We understand the things you have done to protect the semblance of freedom we enjoy today. And I will also say thank you on behalf of all the thoughtless lemmings, and evil-doers who have also benefited from your accomplishments but don't even have the capacity to understand or appreciate everything you have done.

You paid with you life.  The ultimate sacrifice. Thank you is not enough.

May your friends and family find peace.
