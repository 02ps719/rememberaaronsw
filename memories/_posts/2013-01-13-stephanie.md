I understand that it is important to recognize Aaron’s utter brilliance and contributions to the Internet and so many worthy causes. It is. Thank you to those who are highlighting all of the amazing things he did. But to be honest, I didn’t know and admire him for those things. I just knew and admired Aaron. I had some understanding of the fact that he was a hero of the Internet world and beyond. But to me he was t-shirted, funny, warm, loyal, long-haired, Rock Band-addicted, and good at heart. He was Aaron.
