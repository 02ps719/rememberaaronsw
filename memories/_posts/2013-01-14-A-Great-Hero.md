As a single mother of young teen boys and an activist I am appalled and deeply saddened by the treatment of this
brave young man by the authorities.  He inspired many artists and activists and his memory will only strengthen the new young minds to follow in his heroic footsteps towards the freedom of speech and a life of liberty this country was supposedly founded upon but certainly continuingly inspired by.  Rest in peace, young man; a life well lived.  And though I weep that our paths never crossed, and though I weep for your mother and all that knew and loved you, you go with the greats.  Like Aristotle before you, "An unexamined life is not worth living."l you taught us all well.

Much love, Enyaj
