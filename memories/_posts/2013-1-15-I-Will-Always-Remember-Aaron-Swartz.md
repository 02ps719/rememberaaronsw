I want to express my condolences to the family of Aaron and his partner Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman.

If it would no be Aaron, I would have nothing to do in this world. I thank you for bringing him up and for being with him. He gave me hope for a better life.

I am very sad. My mother has killed herself when I was 15, I am 53 now and all I know about this life is that love never dies.

My thoughts are with you and Aaron. I wrote a poem for Aaron today and I have posted it on the main page of my site w-t.me/VILA6z

To God and Aaron Swartz

Take my life,
I am Yours
I am in Your Universe
I can only give me
Let our sweet Aaron be!

If if wouldn't be for Aaron, I wouldn't have a site at all. It's all his hard work.  My love and my tears are with you.
