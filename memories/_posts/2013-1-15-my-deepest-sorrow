To the family and the partner of Aaron Swartz:
I did not know Aaron, but I saw his wonderful photo and I had the impression of knowing him. I am profoundly sad.
As a scholar and an academic, now retired, I understand and applaud what Aaron did. He is a hero in the real struggle for intellectual freedom and for the free circulation of ideas. This cannot be a consolation for you, but I too, like so many others, feel the loss of this magnificent human being. The world is much poorer. My deepest feelings of condolence.
